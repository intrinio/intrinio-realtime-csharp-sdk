[Intrinio](https://intrinio.com/) provides real-time stock prices via a two-way WebSocket connection. To get started, [subscribe to a real-time data feed](https://intrinio.com/real-time-multi-exchange) and follow the instructions below.

[Documentation for our legacy realtime client](https://github.com/intrinio/intrinio-realtime-csharp-sdk/tree/v2.2.0)


## Requirements

- .NET 5+

## Installation

Go to [Release](https://github.com/intrinio/intrinio-realtime-csharp-sdk/releases/), download the DLLs, reference it in your project. The DLLs contains dependencies necessary to the SDK.

## Sample Project

For a sample .NET project see: [intrinio-realtime-options-dotnet-sdk](https://github.com/intrinio/intrinio-realtime-csharp-sdk)

## Features

* Receive streaming, real-time price quotes (last trade, bid, ask)
* Subscribe to updates from individual securities
* Subscribe to updates for all securities

## Example Usage
```csharp
static void Main(string[] _)
{
	Client.Log("Starting sample app");
	client = new Client(OnTrade, OnQuote);
	timer = new Timer(TimerCallback, client, 10000, 10000);
	client.Join(); //Load symbols from config.json
	//client.Join(new string[] { "AAPL", "GOOG", "MSFT" }, false); //Specify symbols at runtime
	Console.CancelKeyPress += new ConsoleCancelEventHandler(Cancel);
}
```

## Handling Quotes

There are thousands of securities, each with their own feed of activity.  We highly encourage you to make your trade and quote handlers has short as possible and follow a queue pattern so your app can handle the volume of activity.

## Data Format

### Trade Message

```fsharp
type [<Struct>] Trade =
    {
        Symbol : string
        Price : float
        Size : uint32
        TotalVolume : uint64
        Timestamp : DateTime
    }
```

* **Symbol** - Ticker symbol.
* **Price** - the price in USD
* **Size** - the size of the last trade.
* **TotalVolume** - The number of stocks traded so far today for this symbol.
* **Timestamp** - a Unix timestamp


### Quote Message

type [<Struct>] Quote =
    {
        Type : QuoteType 
        Symbol : string
        Price : float
        Size : uint32
        Timestamp : DateTime
    }
